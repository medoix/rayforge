# Changelog

All notable changes to Rayforge will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Workflow: a new "Command" step injects custom machine code at any
  position in a layer's workflow (issue #449, phase 1). The step holds
  a multi-line text block; each line is emitted verbatim at the step's
  exact position when the job is encoded, with the same path
  variables as macros (`machine.*`, `layer.*`, `job.*`) — `layer.*`
  also resolves mid-layer. The text travels with the project,
  unexpanded. Geometry-less by design: the step runs once per layer
  with no workpiece dependency, and layers with only Command steps
  can generate a job. A step warning appears when the active
  machine's driver does not consume G-code (e.g. Ruida)

## 1.12.0-beta2

### Added

- Machine: a new Notes category in Machine Settings combines the
  guidance shipped with the device profile with your own notes for
  the machine. Device notes are read-only; My Notes are edited with
  a built-in Markdown editor (headings, emphasis, lists, links,
  code blocks, and expandable details sections). Profile setup
  guidance also appears on the setup wizard's review page, and
  personal notes survive profile updates (thanks to @atkaper, #471)
- Camera: lens calibration now supports ArUco/AprilTag marker grids
  and printable dot grids alongside ChArUco boards. Marker grids
  tolerate partial views, and their dictionary, ID offset, origin
  corner and numbering order are all editable, so factory-printed
  patterns can be calibrated against directly instead of printing
  a new card (thanks to @TOverbye, #466)
- Drivers: the Ruida driver honors the step Power Mode setting —
  Dynamic enables the controller's power scaling and Constant
  disables it. The driver setup gains Power Scaling and Vector
  Power Floor toggles, and serial ports can be bound from a USB
  device dropdown with VID:PID matching (thanks to @StevenIsaacs,
  #476)
- Translations: Hindi is now available

### Changed

- raygeo and raydriver now ship aarch64 (ARM64) Linux wheels, so
  ARM64 installs use prebuilt binaries instead of compiling from
  source

### Fixed

- Framing now works on Ruida machines: framing became a driver
  capability, and the Ruida driver traces the outline with beam-off
  absolute moves (#470)
- Print and cut: capturing an alignment point now accounts for
  Pointer Alignment, so the computed transform no longer lands one
  pointer offset away from the printed marks; the wizard's jog
  panel gains a Pointer Alignment switch (#478)

## 1.12.0-beta1

### Added

- Drivers: a new "Ruida RPA" driver connects Rayforge to Ruida-based
  controllers over USB or UDP directly, or via TUI RPC through the
  Ruida Protocol Analyzer. It ships with all installs, and new
  Generic Ruida RPA and Monport MP-570 60W CO2 device profiles are
  included (thanks to @StevenIsaacs, #404)
- Camera: network cameras are supported as stream sources alongside
  USB cameras, with automatic reconnection after read failures
  (thanks to @atkaper, #438)
- Drivers: a new GRBL driver `GRBL (Rust)` (`GrblSerialNextDriver`):
  the complete GRBL serial protocol stack (character-counting flow
  control, job streaming, stall detection, deadlock recovery,
  cancel/safety shutdown, settings, WCS and probing) now runs in Rust
  through the `raydriver` package. Dialects and settings remain
  Rayforge data; this driver is experimental and can be selected per
  machine as a drop-in alternative to `GRBL (Serial)`
- Machine control: the laser head can now be moved to an arbitrary
  position. A "Move to Position" popover in the Current Position area
  offers direct X/Y (and Z, when available) coordinate entry and hosts
  the selection/workarea corner and WCS origin shortcuts, a "Click
  Canvas to Move Head" mode mirrors Click to Zero, and the canvas
  background context menu gains a "Move Head Here" action. These moves
  run at the configured Jog Speed (#452, #458)
- Machine control: Ctrl+M arms the "Click Canvas to Move Head" mode
  from the keyboard
- Machine control: a per-head pointer offset makes an alignment
  laser's dot a first-class aiming reference. While "Pointer
  Alignment" is on, aiming moves (Move to Position, the corner and
  WCS origin shortcuts, Click Canvas to Move Head, Move Head Here,
  and framing) are shifted so the pointer dot lands on the aimed
  position, zeroing accounts for the offset, and the canvas shows
  the pointer dot next to the beam dot. Starting a job asks whether
  to turn alignment off first, since jobs always burn with the
  unshifted beam (#423)
- Drivers: serial ports can be bound by USB VID:PID instead of a
  device path, so auto-reconnect follows the machine to its new
  port after the OS re-enumerates USB devices (#459)
- Laser: each step gains a Power Mode setting, Dynamic (M4) or
  Constant (M3). Constant power avoids power sags at corners during
  vector cuts, while raster engraving keeps dynamic power (#437)
- Laser: the Frame operation gains a Round Corners toggle and a
  corner radius setting, avoiding sharp, fragile corners without
  hand-drawing a rounded outline (#447, #448)
- Laser: framing at 0% power is now allowed and traces the outline
  with the beam off, so machines with an auxiliary alignment laser
  can frame without firing the main laser
- Sketcher: array tools now also lay out text boxes (#399)
- Machine: the dialect editor warns when "Continuous laser mode" is
  enabled on a dialect whose movement templates have no {s_command}
  placeholder, a combination that previously dropped all laser
  power (#403)
- Machine: G-code fields that contain only a number show a warning,
  since the value is most likely a mistake (#393, #396)
- Devices: a built-in profile for the Creality Falcon A1 Pro
  (thanks to @atkaper, #461)
- Devices: a built-in profile for the Creality Falcon 2 Pro 22W,
  shipping camera lens calibration and image settings as a starting
  default; the 40W profile's work area is corrected to the official
  400 x 415 mm spec (#463)
- Devices: the Falcon A1 and Falcon 10W profiles emit a bounds
  comment in the G-code preamble so their firmware can trace the
  job outline before running it
- Drivers: `move_to` accepts an optional absolute Z target; machines
  with a Z axis receive it in the same move
- Drivers: drivers may opt into live reconfiguration via
  `update_settings` instead of a teardown/rebuild when their setup
  arguments are edited

### Changed

- The prototype Ruida (UDP) driver has been removed; the RuidaRPA
  driver supersedes it, and affected device profiles were migrated
- Raster: the default threshold is now 254, so only pure white stays
  unengraved
- Upgrade raygeo to 1.56.1, which omits zero-length travel moves from
  generated G-code; this builds on 1.55.0's power-mode-aware laser
  commands (constant-power M3 output), frame corner radius support, and
  the contour nesting classification fix (#456)

### Fixed

- Machine: the time estimate in the machine dropdown counts down
  again while a job runs. The ETA now falls back to the job's
  estimated duration when GRBL acknowledges buffered commands faster
  than the machine executes them (previously no estimate was shown
  at all for short jobs), the dropdown refreshes it once per second
  instead of only on driver callbacks, and every bound status label
  (button face and popup rows) receives the update
- GRBL: flow-control state jammed by lost acknowledgements is
  detected and healed, so a firmware that stays silent after a
  cancel (e.g. the Sculpfun iCube over Bluetooth) no longer leaves
  "Read from Device" hanging and the machine controls dead (#428)
- GRBL: the work coordinate offset is refreshed from the WCS
  read-back, so zeroing again right after setting a zero no longer
  reads a stale position and writes the old offset back
- Machine: Z jog moves are clamped to the configured Z axis
  extents, the Move to Position popover accepts the full Z range,
  and the hardware settings page gains Z Min/Z Max rows (#459)
- Camera: the ChArUco card is detected again on blurry, unevenly
  lit frames by falling back through progressively more tolerant
  detection passes (#443, #465)
- Machine: dialect copies on existing machines stay linked to the
  built-in dialect they came from, so fixes to built-in dialects
  reach machines while user edits remain preserved
- Ruida: job encoding is routed by driver capability instead of a
  stale dialect, fixing garbled output after switching drivers (#420)
- Configuration, machine profiles, and recipes are persisted
  atomically with backups, so an interrupted save can no longer
  destroy them (#455)
- macOS: the full-screen main window stays visible when a dialog
  closes on top of it (#453)
- Material test: the test speed is capped at the machine's live
  speed limit (#439, #440)
- SVG: files that define a viewBox but no width/height attributes
  now import at the correct scale (thanks to @MausRundung, #434)
- Laser: rounded Frame corners are rendered with arc tolerance, so
  they come out smooth instead of segmented
- Sketcher: helper geometry now moves together with the array
  members it belongs to
- 3D simulation: the playback slider position is re-derived when the
  playback range shrinks
- Right panel: the estimated job time now stays fully visible in the
  status bar; its container's bottom margin was increased so it is no
  longer clipped behind adjacent widgets

## 1.11.2

### Fixed

- GRBL: cancelling a job now hard-aborts the streaming sender instead
  of waiting for the controller's RX buffer to drain, so the machine
  stops immediately; interactive commands issued while a cancelled job
  is winding down can no longer resume it, and a transient connection
  error no longer grays out the machine controls for the rest of the
  session (#428)
- Selecting a driver that requires connection details no longer
  crashes the app with a GTK assertion and a crash loop at startup
  (#415)
- Machine settings: a fast editing burst of driver setup arguments can
  no longer leave a cancelled driver rebuild touching live driver
  state (#416)
- The Machine Settings dialog is now a single instance per main window
  instead of opening duplicates, and the machine counters action opens
  the maintenance page instead of a nonexistent page (thanks to
  @StevenIsaacs, #416)
- Preview assembly failures for everyday states such as an empty
  document are no longer logged as errors
- Material textures are included again in wheel-based installs,
  repairing blank material thumbnails on flatpak and deb installs
  (#419)

### Changed

- Upgrade raygeo to 1.52.0
- Windows builds now use the UCRT64 environment, following the MSYS2
  deprecation of MINGW64

## 1.11.1

### Fixed

- Importing DXF or LBRN2 files on macOS no longer produces a garbled,
  wrongly scaled result caused by the generic binary MIME type routing
  files to the Ruida importer (#384)
- Sketcher: dragging elements no longer resizes the main window
  because the status bar's width changed while a drag was in progress
  (#385)
- Print and cut: the wizard now launches on machines whose position
  reports include an extra rotary axis instead of failing with an
  unpack error (#394)
- GRBL: reading device settings no longer aborts on grblHAL bitmask
  values, so the settings dialog refreshes correctly (#401)
- Material test: grid dimensions are truncated to whole numbers before
  the test grid is generated, repairing broken grids (#405)

## 1.11.0

### Fixed

- Sketcher: undoing a guide drag no longer spuriously rotates every
  array member, which could cause overlapping rectangles and missing
  contours in ops
- 3D simulation playback no longer stalls on large jobs; the playhead,
  slider, and G-code viewer now stay in sync (#370)
- 3D simulation: rotary arcs are reconstructed correctly, fixing
  stalls, off-cylinder X swings, and a frozen cylinder
- Simulation: playback completion anchors the final command so trailing
  M5s are applied and the laser turns off

### Performance

- Sketcher: point-usage reference counting and coincident-point
  caching make drag operations faster
- Sketcher: solver iterations capped at 5000 to guard against stalls

## 1.11.0-beta3

### Added

- Sketcher: new contour offset tool replaces selected contours with their
  offset; lone circles, arcs, and ellipses are updated in place, while
  chains of connected segments are replaced by a new polygon entity with
  a move/rotate/scale handle frame; open paths become closed slots with
  round end caps, and a live-preview dialog controls the distance
- Sketcher: grouped tools (arrays, constraints, waypoints, rectangles)
  are now presented as pie-menu submenus that appear in a partial outer
  ring when the inner ring runs out of space; radial corridors prevent
  accidental submenu switches

### Changed

- Upgrade raygeo to 1.49.0

### Fixed

- Startup dialogs (consent, setup wizard, profile/schema reviews) now
  run strictly in sequence so they no longer stack into an invisible
  modal that steals input and leaves buttons unresponsive

### Testing

- UI tests now run in a virtual display with a software renderer, so
  they no longer require a running desktop session

## 1.11.0-beta2

### Added

- Sketcher: new curve-along array tool distributes copies of the
  selection along a line, arc, or bezier guide, rotated to follow the
  curve's tangent
- Sketcher: Point on Curve constraint pins a point onto a bezier path;
  select a point plus a curve with the coincident tool
- Sketcher: rectangles are now defined with perpendicular constraints,
  so they stay rectangles when rotated
- Sketcher: circle, ellipse, rectangle, and rounded-rectangle tools
  share one interaction model: drag to commit, Shift draws from the
  center, Ctrl constrains to a square or circle
- Sketcher: dragging a radius point keeps the entity's center pinned
- Raster: dither mode now applies the histogram levels (auto levels,
  brightness range, white point) before dithering, so they shape the
  output; the Power section hides itself when it has no effect

### Changed

- Upgrade raygeo to 1.48.0
- The "Multiple Depths" raster depth mode is disabled on machines whose
  driver cannot support it (e.g. Ruida), and affected steps show a
  warning when opened
- The pie menu has an opaque background with outlined labels and grows
  to fit long item labels
- The right panel collapses entirely when it has no content
- Split the Sculpfun iCube profile into 3W and Pro-5W variants

### Fixed

- Windows: the installer now removes the previous installation before
  copying and aborts with a clear message when files are still locked;
  stale DLLs from older versions no longer crash the app at startup
- Travel speed settings are no longer hidden on machines whose driver
  speaks a binary protocol (e.g. Ruida), and machines created from a
  profile are no longer saved with the wrong G-code dialect
- The machine settings dialog could fail to open when stored driver
  settings did not match the selected driver type
- Discovery: serial ports are probed in parallel and ports that
  answered before a scan timeout are still reported
- Discovery: picking a network device after a USB device no longer
  stamps the board's USB identity onto it, and machines whose USB
  description carries only the brand name still match their profile
- OctoPrint: configured machine dimensions are picked up during
  probing, and transient state text no longer leaks into the profile
  name
- Sketcher: snap lines no longer reference stale geometry, the solver
  no longer re-triggers itself in a loop, and drags no longer jitter
  between moving snap attractors
- Sketcher: constraints violated by re-anchoring an array are now
  flagged
- Canvas: modifier key state is re-synced on focus changes so Shift/
  Ctrl no longer get stuck after dialogs or focus loss

### Performance

- Sketcher drags now solve only the dragged geometry and reuse a cached
  snap index, so dragging stays smooth regardless of sketch size

## 1.11.0-beta1

### Added

- On first launch, the machine setup wizard now opens automatically and
  discovers nearby devices for you
- The wizard checks serial-port and camera permissions before
  discovery, and when access is missing explains how to fix it per
  platform with one-click copyable commands
- Network device discovery via mDNS: OctoPrint servers and ESP3D boards
  appear in the wizard alongside USB serial devices
- Discovery now matches devices to profiles by USB id with confidence
  scoring, and marks already-configured devices as read-only
- GRBL auto-selects the G-code dialect from the `$I` compile flags;
  OctoPrint and Smoothieware are probed over the network
- Sketcher: mirror the selection vertically or horizontally across its
  center
- Sketcher: duplicate the selection in-place with Ctrl+D
- Sketcher: nudge selected entities with the arrow keys
- Sketcher: parametric circular array (polar pattern) tool with a guide
  circle and live preview dialog
- Sketcher: rectangles now create a center point; Shift-click draws the
  rectangle symmetrically around the start point
- New `--script` CLI flag runs Python at startup so scripts can register
  plugins and template functions; built-in text-box template functions
  (date, time, uuid, etc.) are available via a public registry
- `.rfs` sketch files now record a schema version (backward-compatible
  with older files)
- New right panel display mode setting
- 3D preview: a physical, fluence-based burn model chars the stock as
  you engrave (and works for rotary), with a power-keyed scorch ramp and
  heat halo
- Stock material-fold compute nodes in the pipeline, and the material
  manager now guarantees a default stock material

### Changed

- Upgrade raygeo to 1.47.0
- USB serial ports sort ahead of hardware ports; the port selector now
  shows the device path plus a dimmed description, and a configured but
  unplugged port stays pinned to the top
- Tool outputs (laser/aux) are turned off when a job is stopped or
  aborted
- Refined app icon and centralized icon generation
- Updated translations (de, es, fr, pt, uk, zh_CN)

### Fixed

- Slow GRBL serial handshake with grblHAL compatibility level 0
- Discovery shows the real GRBL banner and survives slow-booting devices
- Sketcher: text-editing undo/redo, stale cache, workspace lifecycle,
  control-point drag undo, and font changes are now handled correctly
- Sketcher: Ctrl+S now saves the document instead of triggering the
  symmetry tool
- Line-mode bezier violating the loop-vertex convention
- Bezier flipping to the opposite bow when committing a path segment
- Workflow row step button outline not updating on laser color change
- Sketcher saved-state tracking and history coalescing, with undo/redo
  buttons

### Performance

- Sketcher hot paths optimized: coincident-point lookup, ellipse
  tessellation, arc polygonization, and text-box tool costs
- Snap index is cached and invalidated on registry mutation

## 1.10.3

### Changed

- AppStream metainfo entries reordered and corrected to pass the
  Flathub linter

### Internal

- Added AppStream metainfo validation to lint

## 1.10.2

### Added

- Laser heads now carry physical power data: emission wavelength and
  optical output wattage, with researched values shipped for all
  built-in device profiles and effective fallback values shown when
  unset. These values are not used by any feature yet; they lay the
  groundwork for upcoming physics-based features. Laser settings are
  split into Properties and Optics groups
- Machines created from a device profile now detect when that profile
  has changed and offer a review dialog listing every differing
  setting before applying updates
- The Creality Falcon 10W preamble now turns on the extraction fan
- New device profile for the NEJE Master 2s

### Changed

- Upgrade raygeo to 1.45.1

### Fixed

- Framing applied the active work coordinate system offset twice,
  driving the head toward doubled coordinates (#362)
- A failed background job rebuild could wedge all later job sends;
  failures now surface as an error instead of blocking forever
- Toggling "Rescan Content" on a contour step now takes effect, and
  the threshold row appears directly below it
- Built-in device profiles for two-axis lasers now correctly report
  no Z axis, and the Z setting survives wizard edits and profile
  exports
- Numeric spin entries no longer lose in-progress text when a value
  gets clamped or after switching the display unit
- The 3D simulator camera no longer overshoots or spins wildly on
  far clicks; pan, zoom, and orbit now track the pointer consistently
  in every view
- The simulator always turns the laser off at the end of a job
- Expected cancellations during rapid rebuilds no longer produce
  tracebacks in the log
- Jog panel "Home All" button now sends $H instead of per-axis
  homing commands, fixing a hang on firmwares that do not support
  $HX/$HY/$HZ (#363)

## 1.10.1

### Fixed

- GRBL: the driver now owns the hold/pause state, so the hold/resume
  toggle stays in sync and Resume actually sends "~" instead of
  re-sending "!" (pause)
- GRBL: status polling is no longer starved while the send loop waits
  on a full RX buffer, so driver state no longer goes stale during
  pauses and buffer stalls
- GRBL: a job is now aborted (with a connection error) instead of
  retrying forever when the device stops responding during a buffer
  stall
- GRBL: realtime console commands (~, !, ?) are sent directly via the
  control path instead of being streamed as buffered gcode, so they no
  longer queue behind commands or start phantom jobs
- GRBL: the UI now reflects the RUN state at job start when status
  polling is disabled
- Refusing to start a job while another is running now shows an
  actionable message telling the user to wait for it to finish or press
  Stop
- Machine job failure notifications are now localized per job type
  (frame vs. send) with complete, translatable sentences
- The camera calibration wizard now passes the generated CharucoBoard
  to the capture page, so Capture Frame works again

## 1.10.0

### Added

- Stock is now rendered as solid, physically-shaded solids in the 3D
  canvas, with support for material textures; rotary stock appears as a
  textured cylinder rod with material selection
- Materials can carry textures (with roughness and metallic appearance
  fields) and per-instance stock colors, and textures are optimized to
  WebP to keep material files small
- New 3D canvas visibility toggles for stock, workpiece images, and the
  raster underlay; the no-go zone toggle is hidden when the machine has
  no no-go zones
- New Z-axis presence toggle for 2-axis lasers, and the 3D canvas now
  layers content correctly on machines without a Z axis
- Middle-click orbit now pivots on the object under the cursor instead
  of the floor plane
- Configurable panel orientation: device profiles and the machine
  wizard can rotate the working plane, and the 2D/3D canvases render
  the document in the rotated panel space
- CNC step settings dialog now has a spindle section (head selection,
  RPM, tool diameter, cooling) and icons for all CNC steps
- Material test grid labels are engraved in the user's preferred speed
  unit instead of hardcoded mm/min
- Hidden layers are dimmed in the layer list
- Steps warn when their speed exceeds the active machine's maximum

### Changed

- Upgrade raygeo to 1.43.0 (from 1.39.1)
- Material test step rows are now unit-aware (speed, offset)

### Fixed

- Framing now drives the rotary axis instead of the physical Y axis on
  rotary layers (#356)
- Arcs using more than a full circle no longer collapse when overcut
  (#357)
- Rotary toolpaths no longer sink below the cylinder in the 3d simulator
- Steps with generated workpieces no longer apply to every workpiece in
  the layer
- Material test preview no longer misaligns with the engraved ops after
  the workpiece is resized, and the grid no longer engraves smaller
  than the workpiece
- Raster histogram (levels) changes now commit on release instead of
  mid-drag and invalidate the compute cache properly
- Travel speed setting hidden on machines without support, and the
  speed field cursor no longer jumps when a value is clamped
- Workpiece selectability stays in sync with layer visibility
- 3D canvas: the raster texture underlay now draws correctly, and the
  laser beam no longer draws over the head model
- Ruida driver falls back to the machine reference point for named WCS
  on job start
- Camera alignment/calibration date comparison is now timezone-safe
- Traced contours no longer come out wider than the image content

## 1.9.3

### Added

- The recipe editor now shows all step settings (laser, raster,
  contour, frame, shrinkwrap, wavefront, material test, and CNC),
  matching the step settings dialog
- Layer items can now be renamed inline by double-clicking, using the
  context menu, or pressing F2
- When importing with "Map to Existing" layers, layers that still
  carry auto-generated names (e.g. "Layer 1") are renamed to the
  imported layer's name; manually renamed layers are left untouched

### Changed

- Recipe post-processing settings now use an apply toggle instead of
  the tri-state menu
- Upgrade raygeo to 1.39.1

### Fixed

- Shrinkwrap no longer runs once per face when the workpiece has
  multiple faces
- In the 3D preview, the toolpath and scanline trail are now
  depth-tested against the models, so they no longer draw on top of
  the laser head

## 1.9.2

### Fixed

- Loading projects that store a null ``opsproducer_dict`` no longer
  crashes (e.g. when an engrave step has no legacy producer
  parameters)
- Renaming a step now updates the step list in the main window's right
  pane immediately

## 1.9.1

### Added

- New "CNC Essentials" addon with Experimental CNC machining operations:
  adaptive clearing, flat spiral, helix plunge, inner and outer profiling,
  ramp entry, slotting, and toroidal clearing (disabled by default; enable
  it in the addon manager)
- Pipeline progress now shows the currently running operation with a
  friendly, translatable status label instead of an internal name

### Changed

- Recipes now target one or more step types instead of a single
  capability; the recipe editor gained a searchable step-type selector,
  and existing recipes are migrated automatically
- Post-processor settings (lead-in/out, multipass, overscan) can now be
  stored per recipe and applied to the targeted steps
- Show a confirmation dialog when enabling experimental addons
- Upgrade raygeo to 1.38.3

### Fixed

- Generated G-code could be wrong when axis reversal or a non-bottom-left
  origin was combined with a WCS offset
- Air assist settings in laser steps were not emitted to the G-code
  (M8/M9)

## 1.9.0

### Added

- Playback speeds up to x64 in simulated playback
- 3D preview renders raster scanlines at the physical laser dot
  width for a more accurate preview
- Addon-contributed settings pages now update live when the settings
  dialog is open
- Addon manifests support a default enabled/disabled state

### Changed

- Upgrade raygeo to 1.37.0
- Memory improvements in the pipeline: op data now uses a compressed
  array, assembly intermediates are released between builds, the
  final job ops are no longer cached, and a kinematic mapping is only
  computed when a rotary module is present

### Fixed

- 3D canvas panning now follows the mouse 1:1
- Cylinder angle interpolation during rotary animation could be
  incorrect
- 3D models could obscure ops in the 3D view
- Raster preview artifacts when zooming out (moire) fixed with
  max-reduction mipmaps
- Toolpath and scanline trail drawn above the raster texture
- 3D canvas not grabbing keyboard focus when clicked
- Right panel could obscure the canvas overlays
- 3D model loading errors no longer crash the app
- Machine switch config update now runs on the main thread
- `--exit` watcher is only armed after the uiscript has run

### Performance

- 3D canvas vertex uploads are prepared in a worker thread, reducing
  main-thread stalls during pipeline finishes

## 1.9.0-beta4

### Added

- Simulated playback now advances by simulated machine time at
  (approximately) real machine speed, with a 1x-16x speed multiplier:
  the toolpath reveal, laser head, and laser beam interpolate within
  each command so playback is smooth instead of stepping one command
  per frame
- Step forward/backward buttons glide to the next command over a short
  fixed duration instead of jumping; rapid clicks coalesce into a
  single glide that covers the net number of commands
- Zoom and orbit now rotate around the point under the cursor
- Playback controls (play, step, speed, slider) shown as a bar below
  the 3D canvas
- The 2D and 3D canvas grids draw in the preferred length unit
- Warn when a project uses cooling methods not supported by the
  current machine
- Recipe manager shows the selected step in the recipe description

### Changed

- Upgrade raygeo to 1.33.0: simulated playback now runs at accurate
  machine speed, ops no longer move slightly through the cylinder
  during rotary simulation, and stroke-only cut lines are no longer
  missing from the generated ops
- Internal: 3D canvas refactored into a scene presenter, camera
  controller, playback overlay, renderer registry, and chunked upload
  controller
- Updated translations

### Fixed

- Texture alpha no longer brightens after a layer completes
- Laser beam rendered over the scanline ring buffer
- Scanline overlay stays visible after playback completes
- Legacy opsproducer step parameters migrated when loading projects
- Step settings refresh when a recipe is applied
- Material colors applied per-widget in lists
- Simple GRBL driver wakes an in-flight ping-pong on cancel
- 3D canvas background falls back to the theme view background color
- Frequency and pulse width preserved in MachineState.copy

## 1.9.0-beta3

### Added

- Unit system support: metric/imperial selection in the machine
  settings, with automatic unit-system detection for GRBL (from `$13`)
  and Marlin (via `M149`) drivers and in the configuration wizard
- Length, speed, and acceleration inputs are now unit-aware: they
  convert between the configured display unit and base units, update
  live when the display unit changes, and show the unit as a tooltip
- The 2D and 3D canvas grids now follow the user's preferred length
  unit: grid lines snap to multiples of that unit and axis labels are
  displayed in it, updating live when the preference changes
- Generic service registry and settings-page hooks so addons can
  publish key-resolved services and contribute their own pages to the
  Settings dialog

### Changed
